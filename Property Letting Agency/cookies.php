                    The EU cookie law, in short
                    What does the EU’s ePrivacy Directive say about cookies?
                    The ePrivacy Directive is often known as the EU cookie law 
                    because it was the first piece of legislation to regulate the 
                    use of cookies and trackers, as well as to require websites to 
                    obtain prior consent from users when employing cookies to process 
                    personal data from individuals inside the European Union.

                    The European cookie law (ePrivacy Directive), with its requirements
                    for obtaining end-user consent, is the reason why you’re required 
                    to feature a consent banner on your website that EU visitors can 
                    use to either give or refuse consent to the non-necessary 
                    cookies that process personal data on your domain 
                    (such as search and browser history, IP addresses, etc.).
